      I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of python challenge!
      I will make sure to spend sometime everyday coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
      a day. 
      I'll be using Replit , an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuse for not coding from the middle of a field!
